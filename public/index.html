            <p class="col-start-1 col-end-3 text-lg font-thin tracking-tighter">Veteran full-stack web developer currently freelancing, however always hungry for a new project or opportunity. I was uploaded into the Design world in 2007 via my Technical Program: "Computer Animation & Web Design. There I fell in love with Digital Design & Web Development. There I was able to walk in the door as a Graphic Design Intern at of world re-known graphic design firm "Jager Di Paola Kemp", located in Burlington Vermont. They are now known as "Solidarity of Unbridled Labour". There I gained early professional skills and gained an early preview to the inner workings of a professional environment. The most important takeaway from this experience was the advanced brand strategies applied to delivery quality design products. </p>
            <p class="col-start-1 col-end-3 text-lg font-thin tracking-tighter">I moved to Boston to enrolled at The New England Institute of Art, in their Web Design & Interactive Media curriculum. There I focused on Full-Stack Web Development & User Interface Design. While studying in Boston I was also freelancing & working on home projects. These projects ranged from working with start-up companies build bare-bones web application prototypes; to running “test” PhP scripts at home on self-refurbished laptops to fully install & clone existing WordPress instances on a RDM.</p>
            <p class="col-start-1 col-end-3 text-lg font-thin tracking-tighter">From Boston I went from Full-Stack-Developer to Full-Time-Dad. I now have 3 beautiful children, who have honestly inspired me to jump back into my career. After a few years away from the industry I have returned to freelancing while updating my knowledge with ES6, Angular.JS, Node.JS, TailWind, AWS Cloud & much more.</p>
